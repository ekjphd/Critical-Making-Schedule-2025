## Course Overview
Each week, plan on following the module for all asynchronous activities. Each module will be divided into three sections:

- **Weekly Readings.** Complete this combination of primary and secondary texts prior to starting the making exercise. The full schedule of required readings is listed in the syllabus, but additional recommended readings will also be provided in each module.
- **Making Exercises.** Each week's making exercise will involve experimenting with a different tool for making: guidance will be provided on configuring and getting started with the tool, and students are encouraged to be inventive and playful.
- **Reflective Discussion.** A weekly online discussion will provide the opportunity to share the process of making: the emphasis is not on "success" or "failure," but on growth, exploration, and experimentation.

## Asynchronous Online Course Structure

This course uses a fully asynchronous online format, and relies upon students to complete all readings, engage with both course lectures and other online videos, and join in on course discussions. All assignments are due at the close of their listed module, but will be accepted with no penalty through the next **eight hours**. Late work will not be accepted unless an additional extension has already been approved by the instructor: please reach out early if circumstances will require additional time!

- The course has no synchronous meeting requirements: however, students are encouraged to attend optional events both on-campus and online if possible to build community and skills. Event information will be shared through weekly announcements.
- Assistance is  available via Zoom during office hours and at mutually convenient appointment times, and at any time through Canvas Inbox/email, and Discord direct messaging (we are all on the T&T server). Zoom is recommended for advanced technical problems, where screen-sharing might be helpful to resolving errors.
- Students will need access to a reliable internet connection and computer to participate in this course. Due to some of the tool installation needs, **administrative access to the system** is necessary to complete assignments.
- In the event of an emergency or medical challenge, additional flexibility beyond the grading guidelines is available: when anticipated, students should reach out to the instructor as soon as feasible to form a plan or discuss an incomplete if needed.
